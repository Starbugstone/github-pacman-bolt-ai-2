# pacman-AI-test

A packman clone generated entirely with https://bolt.new ai tool. i did not touch one line of code (apart from this readme).

the most recent deploy should be here :

- ok, I need you to create a pacman clone in javascript that will display on a html page. Preferably integrated in a vuejs module so I can plug it into any page if necessary. you can use whatever plugins needed via NPM.

- I'm impressed. now how about implementing the ghosts. The ghosts must respect the original game AI and also the original name for each ghost should be present in the code

- "bot detected an error : TypeError: this.updateFrightened is not a function" Fixed automaticly

- looking good, but the ghosts have a pathfinding problem and pacman doesn't die when a ghost hit's him.
